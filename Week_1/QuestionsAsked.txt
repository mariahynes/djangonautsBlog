Q.  I have a question about a ticket on Trac. On this particular one, https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/18543, I am wondering why does it say 'new bug', when it was first opened 12 years ago?
A: The header of the ticket in track '#18543 new Bug' has a format like that more or less is  #<id> <status> <Type> , so in your example the status is new and the type is Bug 
The status is not time-based but it say to you that nobody is working on that ticket.
Other examples of different tickets can be:
#35809 closed Bug (fixed)
#35786 assigned Bug

Note: you can link in all the elements of the header and see other tickets with the same status or type. 

Q. Should we install anything locally to check formatting before committing to Django repo?
A. I believe the Django project now uses pre-commit which will force styles when you attempt to commit a change: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/#pre-commit-checks
