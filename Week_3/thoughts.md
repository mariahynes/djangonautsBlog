My first PR got merged! I am writing this a week after though, as it was a very challenging week in work and I got very little time to work on Django. 

This week - onwards and upwards!

Our call last week was useful. It was clear that there is a lot of things about Trac and the docs that have been the same way for a while and it is new contributors that notice if things aren't easy to find. I'll be writing a quick MR to fix one more sentence in the docs about how to assign tickets in TRAC. There was a suggestion from Paolo to open a ticket asking for discussion on how best to update TRAC to make it easier. The question about 'unassigned' vs. 'nobody'? Why two? The difference between 'Accepted' and other values. The 'new' tag when MRs are very old etc etc.

Raised a PR this morning: https://github.com/django/django/pull/18763
I learnt from my mistakes and this time remembered to end the commit message with a full stop and to add alt text to the images that I put up on the PR description.
